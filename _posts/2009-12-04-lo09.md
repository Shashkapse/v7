title: 'An Ensemble of Three Classifiers for KDD Cup 2009: Expanded Linear Model,
  Heterogeneous Boosting, and Selective Naive Bayes'
abstract: This paper describes our ensemble of three classifiers for the KDD Cup 2009
  challenge. First, we transform the three binary classification tasks into a joint
  multi-class classification problem, and solve an l1-regularized maximum entropy
  model under the LIBLINEAR framework. Second, we propose a heterogeneous base learner,
  which is capable of handling different types of features and missing values, and
  use AdaBoost to improve the base learner. Finally, we adopt a selective na√Øve Bayes
  classifier that automatically groups categorical features and discretizes numerical
  ones. The parameters are tuned using crossvalidation results rather than the 10%
  test results on the competition website. Based on the observation that the three
  positive labels are exclusive, we conduct a post-processing step using the linear
  SVM to jointly adjust the prediction scores of each classifier on the three tasks.
  Then, we average these prediction scores with careful validation to get the final
  outputs. Our final average AUC on the whole test set is 0.8461, which ranks third
  place in the slow track of KDD Cup 2009.
