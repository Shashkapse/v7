title: A Combination of Boosting and Bagging for KDD Cup 2009 - Fast Scoring on a
  Large Database
abstract: We present the ideas and methodologies that we used to address the KDD Cup
  2009 challenge on rank-ordering the probability of churn, appetency and up-selling
  of wireless customers. We choose stochastic gradient boosting tree (TreeNet Â®) as
  our main classifier to handle this large unbalanced dataset. In order to further
  improve the robustness and accuracy of our results, we bag a series of boosted tree
  models together as our final submission. Through our exploration we conclude that
  the most critical factors to achieve our results are effective variable preprocessing
  and selection, proper imbalanced data handling as well as the combination of bagging
  and boosting techniques.
