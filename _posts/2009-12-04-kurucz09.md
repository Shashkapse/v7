title: 'KDD Cup 2009 @ Budapest: feature partitioning and boosting'
abstract: We describe the method used in our final submission to KDD Cup 2009 as well
  as a selection of promising directions that are generally believed to work well
  but did not justify our expectations. Our final method consists of a combination
  of a LogitBoost and an ADTree classifier with a feature selection method that, as
  shaped by the experiments we have conducted, have turned out to be very different
  from those described in some well-cited surveys. Some methods that failed include
  distance, information and dependence measures for feature selection as well as combination
  of classifiers over a partitioned feature set. As another main lesson learned, alternating
  decision trees and LogitBoost outperformed most classifiers for most feature subsets
  of the KDD Cup 2009 data.
