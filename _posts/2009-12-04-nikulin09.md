title: Classification of Imbalanced Marketing Data with Balanced Random Sets
abstract: With imbalanced data a classifier built using all of the data has the tendency
  to ignore the minority class. To overcome this problem, we propose to use an ensemble
  classifier constructed on the basis of a large number of relatively small and balanced
  subsets, where representatives from both patterns are to be selected randomly. As
  an outcome, the system produces the matrix of linear regression coefficients whose
  rows represent the random subsets and the columns represent the features. Based
  on this matrix, we make an assessment of how stable the influence of a particular
  feature is. It is proposed to keep in the model only features with stable influence.
  The final model represents an average of the base-learners, which is not necessarily
  a linear regression. Proper data pre-processing is very important for the effectiveness
  of the whole system, and it is proposed to reduce the original data to the most
  simple binary sparse format, which is particularly convenient for the construction
  of decision trees. As a result, any particular feature will be represented by several
  binary variables or bins, which are absolutely equivalent in terms of data structure.
  This property is very important and may be used for feature selection. The proposed
  method exploits not only contributions of particular variables to the base-learners,
  but also the diversity of such contributions. Test results against KDD-2009 competition
  datasets are presented.
