title: "Application of Additive Groves Ensemble with Multiple Counts Feature Evaluation
  to KDD Cup\x9209 Small Data Set"
abstract: "This paper describes a field trial for a recently developed ensemble called
  Additive Groves on KDD Cup\x9209 competition. Additive Groves were applied to three
  tasks provided at the competition using the \x94small\x94 data set. On one of the
  three tasks, appetency, we achieved the best result among participants who similarly
  worked with the small dataset only. Postcompetition analysis showed that less successfull
  result on another task, churn, was partially due to insufficient preprocessing of
  nominal attributes. Code for Additive Groves is publicly available as a part of
  TreeExtra package. Another part of this package provides an important preprocessing
  technique also used for this competition entry, feature evaluation through bagging
  with multiple counts."
