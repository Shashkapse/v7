title: Accelerating AdaBoost using UCB
abstract: "This paper explores how multi-armed bandits (MABs) can be applied to accelerate
  AdaBoost. AdaBoost constructs a strong classifier in a stepwise fashion by adding
  simple base classifiers to a pool and using their weighted \x93vote\x94 to determine
  the final classification. We model this stepwise base classifier selection as a
  sequential decision problem, and optimize it with MABs. Each arm represents a subset
  of the base classifier set. The MAB gradually learns the “utility” of the subsets,
  and selects one of the subsets in each iteration. ADABOOST then searches only this
  subset instead of optimizing the base classifier over the whole space. The reward
  is defined as a function of the accuracy of the base classifier. We investigate
  how the well-known UCB algorithm can be applied in the case of boosted stumps, trees,
  and products of base classifiers. The KDD Cup 2009 was a large-scale learning task
  with a limited training time, thus this challenge offered us a good opportunity
  to test the utility of our approach. During the challenge our best results came
  in the Up-selling task where our model was within 1% of the best AUC rate. After
  more thorough post-challenge validation the algorithm performed as well as the best
  challenge submission on the small data set in two of the three tasks."
